    "We'll train an autoencoder with these images by flattening them into 784 length vectors. The images from this dataset are already normalized such that the values are between 0 and 1. Let's start by building basically the simplest autoencoder with a **single ReLU hidden layer**. This layer will be used as the compressed representation. Then, the encoder is the input layer and the hidden layer. The decoder is the hidden layer and the output layer. Since the images are normalized between 0 and 1, we need to use a **sigmoid activation on the output layer** to get values matching the input.\n",

    "> **Exercise:** Build the graph for the autoencoder in the cell below. The input images will be flattened into 784 length vectors. The targets are the same as the inputs. And there should be one hidden layer with a ReLU activation and an output layer with a sigmoid activation. Feel free to use TensorFlow's higher level API, `tf.layers`. For instance, you would use [`tf.layers.dense(inputs, units, activation=tf.nn.relu)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/dense) to create a fully connected layer with a ReLU activation. The loss should be calculated with the cross-entropy loss, there is a convenient TensorFlow function for this `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` ([documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits)). You should note that `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` takes the logits, but to get the reconstructed images you'll need to pass the logits through the sigmoid function."
